## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To use **Meowverse**, import the required functions and start showing cats with different moods, colors, or even random ones:

```js
import {
  purrfectlyRandomCat,
  rainbowCatFinder,
  moodyCatPicker,
  colorfulMoodCats
} from "meowverse";

const showCats = async () => {
  console.log("Random cat:", await purrfectlyRandomCat());
  console.log("Black cat:", await rainbowCatFinder("black"));
  console.log("Happy cat:", await moodyCatPicker("happy"));
